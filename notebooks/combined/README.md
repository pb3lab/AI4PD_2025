## Basic notebooks for design

- **ProteinMPNN_design_and_folding**
    - Use ProteinMPNN to dessign/redesign a PDB (upload, from PDB, or UniProt)
    - predict new sequences with AF2

- **RFdiffusionAA_ligandMPNN**
    - Run RFDiffusion all atom, e.g. define catalytic residues to hold in place and hold ligand in place
    - run ligandMPNN for created backbones

- **RFdiffusion_MPNN_AF_pipeline**
    - run classic pipeline for design
    - use RFdiffusion for unconditional/conditional backbone generation
    - design created sequences/monomers/binder using ProteinMPNN
    - run Alphafold to predict the structure

- **drive link**
    - find all colab notebooks, **because notebooks are properly shown here** --> from there you should download/copy the notebooks
    - or [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/147XQ4BMFqympJpjW6YxeLkvnPqyIUpSC\?usp\=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/147XQ4BMFqympJpjW6YxeLkvnPqyIUpSC\?usp\=sharing)
