I put some commands in here to try to find 'initial coordinates' for theozyme generation

First open pymol with your protein of interest. 

Then run the line below. This will give you a sphere. You can drag the sphere in pymol to a place where you think ORI tokens should be generated around.


cmd.delete("molecule1");cmd.pseudoatom(object="molecule1", pos=[-1,3,2], elem="ORI", name="ORI", vdw=1.5, hetatm=True, chain='z', segi='z', resn="ORI"); cmd.show("sphere", "molecule1");


After you get the sphere in the correct place, run this command. 

iterate_state 1, molecule1, print(name, x, y, z)

This will print the x y z coordinates of the sphere. You can then use these coordinates as initial coordinates for sampling ORI token locations.
