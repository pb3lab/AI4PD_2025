        "In this notebook, we will exemplify how to combine ProteinMPNN with experimental information about active site residues and evolutionary information – in the form conservation of residues at difference sequence identity percentages from a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) – to perform **native sequence redesign of natural enzymes**.\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial is largely based on the breakthough article by **Kiera Sumida**, published in [JACS in 2024](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.3c10941), with some key differences and similarities:\n",
        "1) As in the original article, active site residues are defined as residues containing backbone atoms within 7 Å or sidechains atoms within 6 Å of the ligand.\n",
        "2) We are using an MSA generated using [MMseqs2](https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2) instead of [HHblits](https://github.com/soedinglab/hh-suite) for retrieven homologous enzymes to generate an MSA. The primary reason for using MMseqs2 over HHblits is its massive speed advantage.\n",
        "3) In the original article, four iterative HHblits searches were performed against the UniRef30 database at E-value cutoffs of 1e-50, 1e-30, 1e-10 and 1e-4. Here, the database being used by MMseqs2 are built from extensive sequence sets like UniRef30 and other environmental sequences\n",
        "4) We maintained the filtering of the sequences in the MSA at 90% sequence identity, 50% coverage and 30% minimum query identity.\n",
        "5) In the original article, each position in the MSA was ranked based on how highly conserved the most frequent amino acid identity was, selecting the top 30%, 50%, and 70% most conserved positions to fix. Here, we are only fixing the top 70% most conserved positions.\n",
        "6) We are using the same ProteinMPNN model, trained with 0.2 Å applied to the training set of protein bacbones.\n",
        "7) Three sampling temperatures were tried for ProteinMPNN during the protein sequence generation stage (0.1, 0.2, 0.3), whereas only one 0.2 is used in this tutorial.\n",
        "8) Only 4 sequences are being generated, whereas 144 sequences were generated in the original article.\n",
        "9) Only model 4 is being used for the AlphaFold predictions, as in the original article, but we are only filtering candidates based on pLDDT >85, and not on Cα RMSD < 2 Å. This will be added in the future."
